Study Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were sown on MSO medium (Duchefa) containg 0.25% phyta-gel and in cubated at 4C for 3 days under short-day condition to induce synchronous germination. They were then transferred to a growth chamber and grown at 22C for 10 days under long-day condition. <br> <br> Transgenic plants were created by Agrobacterium mediated transformation (binary vector pBI121)<br> 	"0.1 g of Arabidopsis were homogenized with 2 ml of guanidinium thiocyanate homogenization buffer. By centrifugation (9000 rpm for 5 min) at room temperature, cell debris had been removed from the suspension. To the suspension solution, the equal volumne of chloroform was added and voltexed for 5 min, then centrifuged. 700 ul of the cushion of CsCl was added in a new tube and 1.2 ml of supernatant was carefully added in upper. The tubes were centrifuged for 14 hrs at 45,000 rpm (Beckman). Following centrifugation, fluid above the 0.5 cm above was removed, and the bottom of the tube filled with 500 ul of 70% ethanol for washing the remnant and pelltet was dissolved in 300 ul of 0.1% DEPC water containing 0.1% SDS. The equal volumn of water saturated water was added the solution and voltexed for 5 min then centrifuged. The surpernatant was yielded and added equal volumn of chloroform. It was voltexed for 5 min and the surpernatant was yield and RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumne of ethanol and 0.1% of 3M NaOAc then stored -20��_ for 2 hr. It was centrifuged for 20 mins at 4C and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. The surpernatant was removed by gentle spiration and then dried for 15-20 mins. RNA was dissolved with 30 ul of DEPC-H2O. The yield of RNA was calculated by measuring the absorbance of the RNA solution at 260 nm and 280 nm. OD 260/280 ratio of RNA solution between 1.8 ~ 2.1 was used for hybridizations."	Genisphere 3DNA Array 50 kit protocol provided by the manufacturer was used without modifications. cDNA synthesis was primed with a 3DNA Array 50 kit Cy3 primer and reverse transcript was performed with TOYOBO AceTra MMLV reverse transcriptase. 	Genisphere 3DNA Array 50 kit protocol provied by the manufacturer was used without modifications. cDNA synthesis was primed with a 3DNA Array 50 kit Cy5 primer and reverse transcript was performed with TOYOBO AceTra MMLV reverse transcriptase. 	"First hybridization was perfomed following 3DNA Array kit protocol provided by the manufacturer. All material generated from 40 ug of total RNA was labeled. Hybridization was carried out overnight (16h) at 55C in a Big Shot (Boekel scientific) hybridization chamber. To dry the washed slides, we put a slide in a slide jar and centrifuged it at 800 rpm. Then, slides were stored in the dark until scanned."	"Microarrays were scanned in both the Cy5 and Cy3 channels with a ScanArray Lite (GSI Lumonics) at 5 um resolution. Slides were scanned first in Cy5 channel, then the Cy3. The fluorescence intensity of the raw scan data was quantified using QuantArray software (Packard BioScience, Billerica, MA, USA)."
