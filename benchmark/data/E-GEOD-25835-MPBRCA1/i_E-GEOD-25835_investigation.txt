STUDY
Study Identifier	"E-GEOD-25835-MP"
Study Title	"Expression data from tumor and normal epithelium derived from BRCA1-mutation carriers"
Study Description	"Microarrays were used to determine relative global gene expression changes in WT and BRCA1-mutation carrier breast epithelium as well as tumors created from WT and BRCA1-mutation carrier breast epithelial cells. Total RNA was isolated from freshly dissociated mammary epithelilal cells obtained from disease-free prophylactic masectomy tissues of 4 different BRCA1-mutation carriers or 4 different reduction mammoplasty tissues from non-mutation carriers. Total RNA was also isolated from fresh tumor tissues derived from in vivo transformed human mammary epithelial cells created from cells obtained from WT or BRCA1-muation carrires. Dissociated mammary epithelial cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding mutant p53, mutant ras, mutant PI3K and cyclin D1 and injected into in humanized glands. There were four tumor tissues isolated for each genetic background."

Study Protocol Description	"ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA-normalized signal intensity"	"Standard Affymetrix protocol; hybridization was performed with high-throughput HT_HG-U133A arrays in 96-well format"	"Cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM+10%FBS, insulin, hydrocortisone and MEGM."	"The data were RMA-normalized using the open-source R-project statistical software with bioconductor packages."	"Scanned using an Affymetrix HT Scanner"	"Following retroviral transduction, cells were treated for 5 days with blasticidin (5ng/ml); after drug selection, cells were grown for at least one week prior to RNA extraction."	"Total RNA was extracted from culture plates for each cell type using an RNeasy Mini kit coupled with an RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen)."	"Standard Affymetrix protocol"
