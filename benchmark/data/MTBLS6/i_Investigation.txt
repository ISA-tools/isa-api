STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS6"
Study Title	"Development and validation of the PyMS Mass Spectrometry software"
Study Submission Date	"2012-03-29"
Study Public Release Date	"2012-03-29"
Study Description	"To provide useful data for development and validation of the PyMS Mass Spectrometry software, a test dataset was run at Metabolomics Australia. A biologically complex mix of a biological background material (foetal calf serum), spiked with 2-fold increasing amounts of a mix of metabolite standards. In addition, a single sample consisting of a simple mix of 45 metabolites representing a variety of chemical classes (sufars, organic acids, amino acids, sugar phosphates), was run through a standard Metabolomics Australia GC-MS analysis. The resulting data is a valuable tool in testing GC-MS data analysis software."

Study Protocol Description	"N/A- Two types of samples were prepared. A mixture of 45 metabolites representing a variety of chemical classes (sugars, organic acids, amino acids, sugar phosphates) was prepared for GC-MS analysis.10 ul of the mixture was transferred to a GC-MS vial insert and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The samples resuspended in 20 mg/ml methoxyamine in pyridine (20µl, 16hr, 25°C) with continuous shaking, followed by derivatization with BSTFA + 1% TMCS (Pierce; 20µl, 1 hr, 25°C) using a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler robot. Second group a Foetal calf serum was spiked with 2-fold increasing amounts of a mix of metabolite standards."	"The Foetal calf serum samples (120µl) were extracted by the addition of 200µl of 3:2 chloroform:methanol, followed by vigorous mixing and incubation on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 4℃ for 10 mins at 16,000 rpm to enable biphasic sparation. 15 µl of the upper aqueous phase was transferred to GC-MS vial inserts and dried in vacuo. The samples were resuspended in 20mg/ml methoxyamine in pyriding (20µl, 16hr, 25℃) with continuous shaking, followed by derivatization with BSTFA + 1% TMCS (Pierce; 20ul, 1hr, 25℃) using a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler robot"	"Gas chromatography was performed using a 30 m VF5-MS column with 0.25mm inner diameter and 0.25mm film thickness (Varian Inc.).Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph interfaced with a 5975C mass selective detector."	"The injection temperature was 250℃, the interface set at 280℃, and the ionsource adjusted to 250℃. The carrier gas was helium (flow rate 1 ml/min). The temperature program was 1 min isothermal heating at 70°C, followed by a 1 °C/min oven temperature ramp to 76 °C, then 5 °C/min to 325 °C and held for 10 min. Mass spectra were recorded at 2.66 scans/s (m/z 50–600)."	"Data Analysis was performed using the PyMS software package (code.google.com/p/pyms). There are two steps, deconvolution (peak picking), and alignment. Each step produces output – for each sample a peak list was created. Deconvolution was carried out using PyMS with the following parameters: Threshold: 6000, Window:13 scan, Num Ions per Peak: 3, Relative Intensity: 2 and Spectral Skewing parameter:2 for the Foetal Calf Serum and Threshold: 3000, and Window:5 scans difference for the Metabolite mix sample. Alignment was carried out using PyMS, with gap penalty 0.3 and retention time modulation parameter 2.5"	""
