STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS1"
Study Title	"NMR based metabolomics of Human Type 2 Diabetes urine samples"
Study Description	"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the result of a combination of impaired insulin secretion with reduced insulin sensitivity of target tissues. There are an estimated 150 million affected individuals worldwide, of whom a large proportion remains undiagnosed because of a lack of specific symptoms early in this disorder and inadequate diagnostics. In this study, NMR-based metabolomic analysis in conjunction with uni- and multivariate statistics was applied to examine the urinary metabolic changes in Human type 2 diabetes mellitus patients compared to the control group. The human population were un medicated diabetic patients who have good daily dietary control over their blood glucose concentrations by following the guidelines on diet issued by the American Diabetes Association. Note: This is part of a larger study, please refer to the original paper below."

Study Protocol Description	""	"Aliquots of 400 µl urine samples were made up to 600 µl with phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.4) and any precipitate removed by centrifugation. In total, 500 µl of supernatant were transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes with 100 µl of sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-(2,2,3,3-2H4)-1-propionate (TSP)/D2O/sodium azide solution (0.05% wt/vol TSP in D2O and 1% wt/vol sodium azide)."	"The spectra of human urine samples were acquired on a Bruker DRX700 NMR spectrometer using a 5 mm TXI ATMA probe at a proton frequency of 700.1 MHz and ambient temperature of 27 °C."	"A 1D NOESY presaturation pulse sequence was used to analyze the urine samples. For each sample 128 transients were collected into 64k data points using a spectral width of 14.005 kHz (20 ppm) and an acquisition time of 2.34 s per FID."	"Spectra were processed using ACD/1D NMR Manager 8.0 with Intelligent Bucketing Integration (Advanced Chemistry Development, Toronto, ON, Canada). Spectra were integrated 0.20-9.30 ppm excluding water (4.24-5.04 ppm), glucose (3.19-3.99 ppm, 5.21-5.27 ppm), and urea (5.04-6.00 ppm). Intelligent bucketing ensures that bucket edges do not coincide with peak maxima, preventing resonances from being split across separate integral regions; a 0.04 ppm bucket width and a 50% looseness factor were used. All spectra were normalized to total area excluding the water, urea, and glucose regions."	"Assignments were confirmed by two dimensional spectroscopy including homonuclear 1H-1H Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY), 1H-13C Heteronuclear Signal Quantum Coherence (HSQC) and 1H-13C Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC) Spectroscopy."	"For the human studies, midstream urine (~15 ml) samples were collected and frozen from each volunteer. In total, 84 samples were collected from 12 healthy volunteers (7 time points, 8 males and 4 females) and 50 samples from 30 T2DM patients (1-3 time points, 17 males and 13 females) with well-controlled blood glucose maintained at normal concentrations by diet, following the guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association, rather than medication. T2DM patients agreed to stop treatment with oral anti-diabetic agents during the study. Subjects went through a washout period of 4 wk before sample collection and abstained from alcohol during the study; diet was controlled throughout the study."
