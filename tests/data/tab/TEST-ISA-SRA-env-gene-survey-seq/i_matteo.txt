In this work, we compared the fecal microbiota of European children (EU) and that of children from a rural African village of Burkina Faso (BF), where the diet, high in fiber content, is similar to that of early human settlements at the time of the birth of agriculture. By using high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing and biochemical analyses, we found significant differences in gut microbiota between the two groups. BF children showed a significant enrichment in Bacteroidetes and depletion in Firmicutes (P < 0.001), with a unique abundance of bacteria from the genus Prevotella and Xylanibacter, known to contain a set of bacterial genes for cellulose and xylan hydrolysis, completely lacking in the EU children. In addition, we found significantly more short-chain fatty acids (P < 0.001) in BF than in EU children. Also, Enterobacteriaceae (Shigella and Escherichia) were significantly underrepresented in BF than in EU children (P < 0.05). We hypothesize that gut microbiota coevolved with the polysaccharide-rich diet of BF individuals, allowing them to maximize energy intake from fibers while also protecting them from inflammations and noninfectious colonic diseases. This study investigates and compares human intestinal microbiota from children characterized by a modern western diet and a rural diet, indicating the importance of preserving this treasure of microbial diversity from ancient rural communities worldwide."Study Submission Date	29/03/10									Study Public Release Date	29/03/10									Study File Name	s_BII-S-7.txtComment[Data Record Accession]Comment[Data Record URI]Comment[Data Repository]Comment[Experimental Metadata Licence]	CC0Comment[Manuscript Licence]	CC BY 3.0Comment[SRA Broker Name]	ISAcreatorComment[SRA Center Name]	OXFORDComment[SRA Center Project Name]	OXFORDComment[SRA Lab Name]	OXFORDComment[SRA Submission Action]	ADDComment[Study Funding Agency]Comment[Study Grant Number]Comment[Subject Keyword]Comment[Supplementary Information File Name]Comment[Supplementary Information File Type]Comment[Supplementary Information File URI]STUDY DESIGN DESCRIPTORS										Study Design Type	Metagenomics									Study Design Type Term Accession Number										Study Design Type Term Source REF										STUDY PUBLICATIONS										Study PubMed ID	20679230									Study Publication DOI										Study Publication Author List	"De Filippo C, Cavalieri D, Di Paola M, Ramazzotti M, Poullet JB, Massart S, Collini S, Pieraccini G, Lionetti P."									Study Publication Title	Impact of diet in shaping gut microbiota revealed by a comparative study in children from Europe and rural Africa.									Study Publication Status	indexed for MEDLINE									Study Publication Status Term Accession Number										Study Publication Status Term Source REF										STUDY FACTORS										Study Factor Name	diet									Study Factor Type	diet									Study Factor Type Term Accession Number										Study Factor Type Term Source REF										STUDY ASSAYS										Study Assay File Name	a_matteo-assay-Gx.txt									Study Assay Measurement Type	environmental gene survey									Study Assay Measurement Type Term Accession Number										Study Assay Measurement Type Term Source REF										Study Assay Technology Type	nucleotide sequencing									Study Assay Technology Type Term Accession Number	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000626									Study Assay Technology Type Term Source REF										Study Assay Technology Platform	454 Genome Sequencer FLX									STUDY PROTOCOLS										Study Protocol Name	feces collection	nucleic acid extraction	PCR amplification	library construction	nucleic acid sequencing					Study Protocol Type	sample collection	nucleic acid extraction	polymerase chain reaction	library construction	nucleic acid sequencing					Study Protocol Type Term Accession Number										Study Protocol Type Term Source REF										Study Protocol Description	"All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Florence Human Research Committee. Because fecal samples are readily attainable and representative of interpersonal differences in gut microbial ecology, they were collected from each individual and preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen). The major obstacles to analyze fecal samples in distant area such as rural Burkina Faso village is due to the fact that standard fecal collection procedures require fresh or frozen samples, which limit its application in rural Africa type community-based setting. Since new technologies have become available to preserve tissue DNA and RNA for a period of time at room temperature, application of such technologies to fecal samples may have great potential for epidemiological studies (S1). For this reason fecal samples of Burkina Faso and Italian children were collected by MDs and preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen) at 4 C for the first 24 hours, and then kept at -80 C until the extraction of nucleic acids. During the procedure of transport and storage we lost one of the BF fecal sample whose DNA quality did pass the QC, reducing the BF samples from 15 to 14. Fecal samples from EU children were collected also in tubes containing RNAlater (Qiagen) and were kept one week at -4 C and subsequently moved at -80 C until the analyses were performed, to reproduce the same conditions of BF samples."	"The genomic DNA extraction procedure was based on protocol proposed by Zoetendal et al. (S2). After dissolution of about 5 g of each fecal sample in physiological solution and homogenization by vigorous shaking by hand, 600 ?l of the suspension was centrifuged (10,000 g, for 10 minutes at 4 C) to collect pellets. The pellets were dissolved in 1 ml ice-cold 1X-PBS and centrifuged at 700 g at 4 C for 1 minute. The supernatants were transferred into a 15 ml tube and were centrifuged at 9000 g at 4 C for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the pellets were suspended in 2.8 ml TE buffer by repeated pipetting. Then, 180 ul of SDS 10% (w/v) and 18 ul of Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) were added. The samples were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. Afterward, 20 ul RNase (40 ug/ml) was added and incubated at RT for 5 minutes. An equal volume of phenol/chloroform (50:50) was added and the samples were shaken well until the phases were completely mixed. The mixtures were centrifuged at 4500 g for 2 minutes. The upper layers were transferred into a new tube. This step was repeated again so that the interface of the two layers was clean. Then, 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and two volumes of 96% ethanol were added and mixed gently. The mixtures were stored overnight at -20 C to precipitate the genomic DNA, then the samples were centrifuged at 4 C at 9000 g for 10 minutes. The precipitated genomic DNA was washed twice into 1 ml of 70% ethanol. Finally, dried samples were suspended in 200-400 ul H2O. DNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry measuring OD 260/280. Only samples with good DNA quality were processed. Extracted DNA was stored at -20 C."	"PCR amplification of the V5-V6 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. For each sample, we amplified 16S rRNA genes using a primer set corresponding to primers 784F and 1061R described by Andersson et al. (S3). These PCR primers target the V5 and V6 hyper-variable 16S RNA region. The forward primer contained the sequence of the Titanium A adaptor (5'-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG-3') and a barcode sequence. For each sample, a PCR mix of 100 ?l was prepared containing 1X PCR buffer, 5U of Faststart High Fidelity polymerase blend and dNTPs from the FastStart High Fidelity PCR system (Roche), 200 nM of primers (Eurogentec) and 100 ng of gDNA. Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 95 C for 5 minutes followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 C for 40 seconds, annealing at 55 C for 40 seconds, and extension at 72 C for 1 minute, with a final extension of 7 minutes at 72 C for. Amplicons were visualized on 1.0% agarose gels using SYBR Safe DNA gel stain in 0.5X TBE (Invitrogen). Amplicons were cleaned using the HighPure Cleanup kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer instructions."	"Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instruction. Assays were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black, 96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the 485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation, cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40 minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry."						Study Protocol URI										Study Protocol Version										Study Protocol Parameters Name				target_taxon;target_gene;target_subfragment;pcr_cond;pcr_primers;library selection;library source;library layout;library strategy;mid	sequencing instrument;quality scorer;base callerStudy Protocol Parameters Name Term Accession Number				;;;;;;;;;	;;					Study Protocol Parameters Name Term Source REF				;;;;;;;;;	;;					Study Protocol Components Name					454 FLX Titanium					Study Protocol Components Type					DNA sequencer					Study Protocol Components Type Term Accession Number										Study Protocol Components Type Term Source REF										STUDY CONTACTS										Study Person Last Name	Carlotta	Matteo	Paolo	Duccio	Di Paola	Jean-Baptiste	Sebastien	Giuseppe	Silvia	Rocca-SerraStudy Person First Name	de Filippo	Ramazzotti	Lionetti	Cavalieri	Monica	Poullet	Massart	Pieraccini	Collini	PhilippeStudy Person Mid Initials										Study Person Email	carlotta.defilippo@unifi.it	matteo.ramazzotti@unifi.it	paolo.lionetti@unifi.itpaolo.lionetti@unifi.it	duccio.cavalieri@unifi.it	monica.dipaola@unifi.it	jean-baptistepoullet@dnavision.be	s.massart@dnavision.be			proccaserra@gmail.comStudy Person Phone										Study Person Fax										Study Person Address										Study Person Affiliation	"University of Florence, Italy"	"University of Florence, Italy"	"University of Florence, Italy"	"University of Florence, Italy"	"University of Florence, Italy"	DNA Vision	DNA vision	"University of Florence, Italy"	"University of Florence, Italy"	Study Person Roles	principal investigator role	scientist	principal investigator role	scientist	scientist	scientist	scientist	scientist	scientist	SRA Inform On Status;SRA Inform On ErrorStudy Person Roles Term Accession Number										;Study Person Roles Term Source REF										;Comment[Study Person REF]
