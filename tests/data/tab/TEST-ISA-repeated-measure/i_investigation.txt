STUDY
Study Identifier	"TEST-Template5-repeatedmeasure"
Study Title	"TEST-Template5-repeatedmeasure"
Study Description	"TEST-Template5-repeatedmeasure: more complex example, with 2 subjects, undergoing 4 distinct interventions, the order in which those are applied differs between the 2 subjects. interventions are identified as distinct protocols, whose application is identified by a date. intervention protocols are followed by a sample collection event, yielding from each subject 1 sample for the first 3 interventions and then 2 samples after the last intervention. Note: for repeated measure/longitudinal use cases, it is necessary for users to rely on 'Date' field associated to Protocol to allow for ordering along timeline. failing to do so prevents from distinguishing the information from a regular splitting. conversely, in ISA1.0, there can be cases where distinguishing a repeated measure design from other situation can be tricky."
