Study Title	"Simultaneously discovering the fate and biochemical effects of a xenobiotic through untargeted metabolomics"
Study Description	"Untargeted metabolomics is an established approach in toxicology for characterising endogenous metabolic responses to xenobiotic exposure. Detecting the xenobiotic and its biotransformation products as part of the metabolomics analysis provides an opportunity to simultaneously gain deep insights into its fate and metabolism, and to associate the xenobiotic’s internal relative dose directly with endogenous metabolic responses. This integration of untargeted exposure and response measurements into a single assay has yet to be fully demonstrated. Here we implemented a novel workflow to extract and analyse xenobiotic-related measurements from routine untargeted UHPLC-MS metabolomics datasets, derived from in vivo (rat plasma and cardiac tissue) and in vitro (human cardiomyocytes) studies that were principally designed to investigate endogenous metabolic responses to drug exposure. Our findings clearly demonstrate how untargeted metabolomics can discover extensive xenobiotic biotransformation maps, temporally-changing relative systemic exposure, and direct associations of endogenous biochemical responses to the internal dose."

Study Protocol Description	"<p><strong><em>In vivo</em></strong></p><p>Rats (Han-Wistar – Crl:WIST; 240 - 260 g or 220 - 240 g for male and female, respectively) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (CRL) UK. Animals were housed as previously described [1].</p><p>Animals were grouped randomly for the purposes of the study: groups 1 – 4 were formed of N = 5 male rats, groups 5 – 8 were formed of N = 5 female rats. Sunitinib and KU60648 were formulated in 20% w/v aqueous (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) and administered orally. Sunitinib-exposed rats (groups 6 and 8) were dosed with 25 mg/kg/day (10 mL/kg/day) of sunitinib malate for 14 days. KU60648-exposed rats (groups 2 and 4) were dosed with 150 mg/kg/day (10 mL/kg/day) for 2 days, then with 225 mg/kg/day (10 mL/kg/day) on day 3. These doses were considered suitable for investigation based on previous studies demonstrating tolerance to these doses.</p><p>Blood samples for untargeted metabolomics were taken on days 1 and 2 (groups 1-4), day 1 and 4 (groups 5-6) or days 2 and 8 (groups 7-8) at 4 hrs post-dose. Terminal samples were also taken 24 hrs post-dose (day 4, groups 1-4) and 28 hrs post-dose (day 15, groups 5 – 8). 300 μL whole blood was collected via the tail vein, mixed with Lith Hep anticoagulant, and used to derive approximately 150 μL of plasma for analysis. KU60648-exposed rats (groups 2 and 4) and corresponding vehicle controls (groups 1 and 3) were terminated on day 4. Sunitinib-exposed rats (groups 6 and 8) and corresponding vehicle-controls (groups 5 and 7) were terminated on day 15. Following termination, the whole heart was removed (groups 3, 4, 7 and 8), with the apex sectioned for untargeted metabolomics analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>In vitro</em></strong></p><p>Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (Cellular Dynamics International, Fujifilm, USA) were defrosted according to manufacturers instructions, and plated at 500,000 cells per well in 6-well plates pre-coated with 0.1% gelatin. (Each well formed a time-point N, and was repeated from 3 separate vials). After plating in Cardiomyocyte plating media, cells were cultured in Cardiomyocyte maintence media from 48 hours post plating, until end of experiment. 10 days post-plating, the cardiomyocytes were treated with either 0.1% DMSO (control) or 5 μM sunitinib (treated), for either 1, 6 or 24 hours, added as part of a media change. Once the exposure time had elapsed, plates were placed on wet ice, the media was removed (to microcentrifuge tubes), then wells were washed twice with 1 mL cold 0.9% NaCl. Plates were then immediately frozen on dry ice. Media samples were spun at 10,000g for 5 mins at 4°C to remove any cell debris. The supernatants were then transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes. All samples were stored at -80°C prior to metabolomic analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>[1] Adeyemi, O., Parker, N., Pointon, A. &amp; Rolf, M.

Tissue sizes ranged from 54-124 mg. 8 μL/mg wet tissue mass of ice-cold methanol (LC-MS grade, VWR International, UK) and 3.2 μL/mg ice-cold water (LC-MS grade, VWR International, UK) was added to frozen tissue samples, which were homogenised in a bead-based homogenisation system (Precellys 24 with CK28 tubes, Stretton Scientific, UK). The homogenate was transferred to a 1.8 mL glass vial and 8 μL/mgi ce-cold chloroform (HPLC grade, Fisher Scientific, UK) and 4 μL/mg water were added. Sample was vortexed (30s), left on ice (10 min, for extraction) and centrifuged (2,500-g, 4⁰C,10 min). Sample was set at room temperature (approximately 20⁰C) for 5 min to complete phase partitioning. Fixed volumes of the polar (400 μL – equivalent to 30 mg extracted tissue) and non-polar (250 μL – equivalent to 30 mg extracted tissue) were removed and dried in a SpeedVac sample concentrator (Savant SPD111V230, Thermo Fisher Scientific)or a nitrogen blow down drier (Techne FSC400D, Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively.Samples were stored at -80⁰C until analysis. To create polar quality control (QC) samples an extra 300 μL of the polar extract (post-bi-phase partition) was taken from each sample, mixed (vortexed 30 s) and aliquoted (400 μL) before drying by SpeedVac. To create non-polar quality control (QC) samples an extra 200 μL of the non-polar extract (post-bi-phase partition) was taken from each sample, mixed (vortexed 30 s) and aliquoted (250 μL) before drying by nitrogen blow down drier. Extract blank samples were created by carrying out the above procedure in the absence of tissue. Prior to UHPLC-MS analysis, dried samples were resuspended in 300 μL 3:1 acetonitrile:water (polar extracts) or 300 μL 3:1 isopropanol:water (non-polar extracts), vortexed (30 s), centrifuged (20,000-g, 4⁰C, 20 min)and 100 μL supernatant loaded into a low recovery HPLC vial (Chromatography Direct, UK).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Extraction of polar metabolites and lipids from adherent cells</strong></p><p>6-well plates (containing washed cells with all liquid removed) were placed on dry-ice and 600 μL of 2:0.8 methanol:water (prechilled on dry ice for 60 min) was added to each well.Cells were dislodged into the solvent using a cell scraper (Corning) and all cells and liquid were removed into a fresh 1.8 mL glass vial. A further 240 μL of prechilled 2:0.8methanol:water was added to the well, scraped and all contents added to the 1.8 mL glass vial. 600 μL ice-cold chloroform and 300 μL ice-cold water were added to the 1.8 mL glass vial and sample was vortexed (30s), left on ice (10 min, for extraction) and centrifuged (2,500-g, 4⁰C, 10 min). Sample was set at room temperature (approximately 20⁰C) for 5 min to complete phase partitioning. Fixed volumes of the polar (900 μL) and non-polar (600 μL)were removed and dried in a SpeedVac sample concentrator (Savant SPD111V230, ThermoFisher Scientific) or a nitrogen blow down drier (Techne FSC400D, Thermo FisherScientific), respectively. Samples were stored at -80⁰C until analysis. Extract blank samples were created by carrying out the above procedure in the absence of cells. Prior to UHPLCMS analysis, dried samples were resuspended in 150 μL 3:1 acetonitrile:water (polar extracts) or 150 μL 3:1 isopropanol:water (non-polar extracts), vortexed (30 s), centrifuged(20,000-g, 4⁰C, 20 min) and 100 μL supernatant loaded into a low recovery HPLC vial (Chromatography Direct, UK). To create the quality control (QC) samples, the remaining 50μL liquid from each centrifuged resuspended sample was pooled (for polar and non-polar separately), vortexed and moved to a low recovery HPLC vial (Chromatography Direct, UK) for direct analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Extraction of polar metabolites and lipids from biofluids (plasma and cell media)</strong></p><p>Samples were prepared in accordance with previous studies [3], with some minor changes. Biofluids (plasma or cell media) were thawed on ice and briefly vortexed (5 s). 50 μL of the biofluid was mixed with either (i) 150 μL 100% ice-cold acetonitrile (LC-MS grade, VWR International; polar metabolite extraction for HILIC analysis], or (ii) 150 μL 100% ice-cold isopropanol (LC-MS grade, VWR International; lipid extraction for C18 RP]. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged (20,000-g, 4⁰C, 20 min) and 100 μL supernatant removed into a low recovery HPLC vial (Chromatography Direct, UK) for direct analysis. To create the QC samples, 50 μL of each plasma sample (plasma QC) or 50 μL of each media sample (media QC) was pooled, vortexed (30 s) and split into several 50 μL aliquots.

For the HILIC method, an Accucore 150 Amide column (100 x 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. Mobile phase A was 95% acetonitrile/water (10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B was 50% acetonitrile/water (10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid). The gradient was as follows: t = 0.0, 1% B; t = 1.0, 1% B; t = 3.0, 15% B; t = 6.0, 50% B; t = 9.0, 95% B; t = 10.0, 95% B; t = 10.5, 1% B; t = 14.0, 1% B. All changes were linear (curve = 5). The flow rate was 0.50 mL/min and the column temperature 35°C. For the RP C18 chromatography, a Hypersil GOLD C18 column (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.9 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was employed. Mobile phase A was 60% acetonitrile/water (10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B was 85.5% propan-2-ol/9.5% acetonitrile/5% water (10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid). The gradient was as follows: t = 0.0, 20% B; t = 0.5, 20% B, t = 8.5, 100% B; t = 9.5, 100% B; t = 11.5, 20% B; t = 14.0, 20% B. All changes were linear (curve = 5). The flow rate was 0.40 mL/min and the column temperature 55°C.</p>"	"<p>In all cases analysis was performed in positive and negative ionisation modes separately at a resolution of 70,000, between 70-1050 m/z (HILIC) and 150-2000 m/z (RP C18). The sample injection volume was 2 μL. MS2 fragmentation data was collected by data-dependent acquisition (DDA using ‘Discovery Mode’) of QC samples using HCD with stepped normalised collision energies (NCEs) (HILIC 25, 60, 100%; RP C18 20, 50, 80%). For HILIC and RP C18 separately, MS2 data was collected for 3 different m/z ranges from 3 separate injections. Scan ranges were: HILIC m/z 70-200, m/z 200-400, and m/z 400-1000; C18 RP m/z 200-400, m/z 400-700 and m/z 700-1500. Additional MS2 fragmentation data of putative xenobioticrelated features was collected by DDA, using targeted inclusion lists across multiple injections of selected xenobiotic-exposed samples, using HCD with stepped NCEs (HILIC 25, 60, 100%; RP C18 20, 50, 80%). For MS2 fragmentation data acquisition, analysis was performed at a resolution of 35,000 and 17,500 for full scan (MS1) and MS2, respectively.</p>"	"<p><strong>Raw data processing</strong></p><p>Vendor format raw data files (.RAW) were converted to mzML file format using ProteoWizard software [1]. Full scan (MS1) data deconvolution was performed by XCMS operated in Galaxy [2], as reported previously [3] (settings: min. peak width (HILIC = 4; RP C18 = 6); max. peak width (30); ppm (HILIC = 12; RP C18 = 14); mzdiff (0.001); bw (0.25); mzwid (0.01); minfrac (0.2)).

Lipid features within the UHPLC-MS2 data were searched against the entire in silico HCD database (5 ppm mass error). Only annotations graded A - C were used for annotation purposes (Grade A – all fatty acyl chains and class were completely identified; Grade B – some fatty acyl chains and the class were identified; Grade C – either the lipid class or some fatty acyls were identified).
