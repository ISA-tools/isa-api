The open source ISA metadata tracking tools help to manage an increasingly diverse set of life science, environmental and biomedical experiments that employing one or a combination of technologies.

Built around the ‘Investigation’ (the project context), Study’ (a unit of research) and ‘Assay’ (analytical measurement) general-purpose Tabular format, the ISA tools helps you to provide rich description of the experimental metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technology and measurement types, sample-to-data relationships) so that the resulting data and discoveries are reproducible and reusable.

To find out more about ISA, see [https://isa-tools.org/](https://isa-tools.org/)

To find out who's using ISA and about the ISA development and user community, see [www.isacommons.org](http://www.isacommons.org)

The *ISA API*  aims to provide you, the developer, with a set of tools to help you easily and quickly build your own ISA objects, validate, and convert between serializations of ISA-formatted datasets and other formats/schemas (e.g. SRA schemas). The ISA API is published on PyPI as the `isatools` package.

`isatools` currently supports Python 3.6+.
