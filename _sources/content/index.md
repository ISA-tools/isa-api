ISA tools API
=============

The ISA tools API is published on PyPI as the `isatools` Python package.
The package aims to provide you, the developer, with a set of tools to
help you easily and quickly build your own ISA objects, validate, and
convert between serializations of ISA-formatted datasets and other
formats/schemas (e.g. [SRA
schemas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/read-xml-format-1-5)). The
goal of this package is to provide a flexible way to build and use ISA
content, as well as provide utility functions for file conversions and
validation.



```{note}
`isatools` is currently only supported in Python 3.4 and 3.5. Python 2.7
support is present in the `py2` source code branch in Github.
```
